# Web Jam Team 8 

About
Campics is a photo sharing web application for students from different universities to share photos from their campus. 
Users are also able to experience the life of a college student on any campus through brand new photos being uploaded.


Authors
As a team of four, we created Campics for the WebJam Winter 2013 hosted by ICS Student Council. 
We are a dynamic mix of passionate developers from UC Irvine.
